# DashDash

A fast-paced, gravity-flipping arcade runner built with JavaFX and FXGL.

## Description

DashDash is a side-scrolling "infinite runner" where the player controls a cube navigating through a hazardous environment. DashDash utilizes a gravity-inversion mechanic—pressing Space flips the player between the floor and ceiling. The project demonstrates core game development concepts including Entity-Component System (ECS) architecture, collision physics, persistent data saving, and dynamic UI binding.
